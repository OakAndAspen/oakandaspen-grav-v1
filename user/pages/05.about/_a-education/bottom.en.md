## My education

Promised to a literary career from a very young age, my life took an unexpected turn during my time in high school. Almost ten years later, I find myself with a title of engineer, doing freelance web development and launching a startup. Here's how I got there.

Federal matura | VET diploma in general IT | Bachelor's degree in media engineering

<strong>Gymnase de Burier (VD)</strong> - I tried programming for the first time during the optional IT course, learning HTML, CSS, PHP, Java and Visual Basic. This experience awoke in me an interest for programming, and I decided to follow that road. | <strong>Ecole des Métiers du Valais</strong> - I acquired basic knowledge in Java and C#, web development, networks and systems. It is during that time that I started coding for pleasure and for my personal use. However, I wanted to widen my options and my skills to more than just IT. | <strong>Haute Ecole d'Ingénierie et de Gestion du Canton de Vaud (HEIG-VD)</strong> - This cursus, in addition to refining my web development skills, gave me new skills in communication, marketing, project management, business and a bit of graphic design.  I also had the opportunity to work in a team on several large projects.
